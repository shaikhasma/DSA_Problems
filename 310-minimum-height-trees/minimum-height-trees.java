/*
(1) A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are
connected by exactly one path.

(2) Any connected graph who has n nodes with n-1 edges is a tree.

(3) The degree of a vertex of a graph is the number of
edges incident to the vertex.

(4) A leaf is a vertex of degree 1. An internal vertex is a vertex of
degree at least 2.

(5) A path graph is a tree with two or more vertices that is not
branched at all.

(6) A tree is called a rooted tree if one vertex has been designated
the root.

(7) The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest
downward path between root and a leaf.
